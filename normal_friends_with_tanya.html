    <p><strong>Normal Friends with Tanya Goswami</strong> is an iconic (yet suspiciously underrated) friendship that has stood the test of time, snacks, and several Delhi heatwaves. This friendship is allegedly "normal" — although sources disagree on what exactly that means.<sup class="citation">[1]</sup></p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The friendship began under mysterious but definitely very regular circumstances. Eyewitnesses claim it involved a cup of chai, a passive-aggressive meme, and a mutual love for dramatic exits.</p>

    <h2>Key Events</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>March 2023 – First brunch where nothing dramatic happened. (Allegedly.)</li>
        <li>July 2024 – Tanya says "let’s do something normal" and books a trip to the hills with 14 strangers.</li>
        <li>December 2024 – Both friends agree to “not talk for a bit” and accidentally set a world record for mutual ghosting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Quotes</h2>
    <blockquote>"I'm just saying, this is very normal behavior." – Tanya Goswami</blockquote>
    <blockquote>"We are not weird, YOU are weird." – Anonymous friend, probably not Tanya</blockquote>

    <h2>Legacy</h2>
    <p>The duo continues to redefine the meaning of 'normal friendship' by consistently doing things that are absolutely not normal. Cultural analysts remain confused.<sup class="citation">[2]</sup></p>
